- ✅ Add descriptive captions at the top

- ✅ Ensure text is readable
- ✅ Use device frames for professional look
- ✅ Keep background simple or use app's purple gradient

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Include placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum"
- ❌ Make claims you can't back up

### Text Captions

**Caption Style:**
- Font: San Francisco (Apple's system font) or similar
- Size: Large enough to read on small displays
- Color: White text on gradient, or gradient text on white
